## Source Not Generated

**Always edit source files, never generated output.** When a file is produced by a generator (prepare-runbook.py, skill expansion, template rendering), edit the source that produces it. Changes to generated files are overwritten on next generation.

**If unsure which is source:** Ask before editing.
