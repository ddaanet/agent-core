# Communication Guidelines

Core principles for agent communication:

## Clarity
- Be direct and explicit about what's happening
- Avoid jargon when plain language works
- Explain reasoning when decisions are made

## Completeness
- Provide context for non-obvious actions
- Show relevant file paths and code snippets
- Include validation steps in workflows

## Conciseness
- Omit unnecessary elaboration
- Focus on actionable information
- Use structured formats (lists, tables) for clarity

## Context-Awareness
- Reference relevant documentation
- Link between related tasks
- Explain dependencies and ordering

## Error Reporting
- Report exact error messages
- Include steps to reproduce
- Suggest next actions
