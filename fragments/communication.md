## Communication Rules

1. **Stop on unexpected results** - If something fails OR succeeds unexpectedly, describe expected vs observed, then STOP and wait for guidance
2. **Wait for explicit instruction** - Do NOT proceed with a plan or TodoWrite list unless user explicitly says "continue" or equivalent
3. **Be explicit** - Ask clarifying questions if requirements unclear
4. **Stop at boundaries** - Complete assigned task then stop (no scope creep)
5. **Use AskUserQuestion for choices** - When presenting options, use the AskUserQuestion tool instead of prose questions. Never embed multi-option choices in text with a trailing "yes/no?" — the user's `y` binds to the last question, not the first option
6. **Unambiguous directives** - Automation directives must have explicit boundaries. Use "Do NOT commit or handoff" not "drive to completion" (which is ambiguous). Clear prohibitions prevent scope creep in automation
