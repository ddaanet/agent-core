# Memory Index

Condensed knowledge catalog. Read referenced files when working in related areas.

**Append-only.** Never remove or consolidate entries — each entry is a keyword-rich discovery surface for on-demand knowledge. Growth is bounded by consolidation rate (~5-10 entries/session) and total token cost is modest (200 entries ≈ 5000 tokens).
