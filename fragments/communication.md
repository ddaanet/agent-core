## Communication Rules

1. **Stop on unexpected results** - If something fails OR succeeds unexpectedly, describe expected vs observed, then STOP and wait for guidance
2. **Wait for explicit instruction** - Do NOT proceed with a plan or TodoWrite list unless user explicitly says "continue" or equivalent
3. **Be explicit** - Ask clarifying questions if requirements unclear
4. **Stop at boundaries** - Complete assigned task then stop (no scope creep)
5. **Unambiguous directives** - Automation directives must have explicit boundaries. Use "Do NOT commit or handoff" not "drive to completion" (which is ambiguous). Clear prohibitions prevent scope creep in automation

## Prose Quality

- State information directly — no hedging, framing, or preamble
- Answer immediately — skip acknowledgments and transitions
- Reference, never recap — assume the reader has context
- Let results speak — no framing around visible output
- Commit to answers — no hedging qualifiers
