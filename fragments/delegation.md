# Delegation Patterns

Guidelines for delegating tasks and responsibilities:

## Task Delegation Criteria

Delegate to another agent when:
- Expertise in specialized domain is required
- Parallel execution would improve efficiency
- Task scope is well-defined and independent
- Acceptance criteria are clear

## Handoff Protocol

When delegating:
1. **Define scope clearly**: What is included/excluded
2. **Specify acceptance criteria**: How to know it's complete
3. **Provide context**: Reference files, background information
4. **Agree on communication**: How to report progress
5. **Set boundaries**: Decision authority, escalation points

## Task Dependencies

- Identify blocking dependencies upfront
- Order work to minimize blocking
- Document dependency chains
- Provide fallback options when dependencies are uncertain

## Quality Gates

- Specify validation requirements
- Define "done" explicitly
- Include acceptance testing steps
- Plan for integration points

See tool-preferences.md for tool-specific delegation guidance.
