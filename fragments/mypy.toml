# Mypy configuration fragment - Shared settings
#
# This file contains the intersection of mypy configurations across agent projects.
# All projects use strict type checking with test file exceptions.
#
# Template variables for customization:
#   - python_version: Default is 3.12 (baseline), uncomment to override
#   - files: Directory paths to type-check (customize per project)
#   - mypy_path: Additional paths for module resolution (project-specific)
#
# Recommended project-specific additions:
#   [[tool.mypy.overrides]]
#   module = "tests.*"
#   disallow_untyped_defs = false      # Tests don't need full type annotations
#   disallow_incomplete_defs = false   # Tests can have incomplete annotations

[tool.mypy]
# Python version - baseline is 3.12, uncomment to override
# python_version = "3.12"

# Core settings - all projects use these
strict = true                    # Enable all strict type checking
extra_checks = true              # Enable optional error messages
error_summary = false            # Suppress error summary (detailed output preferred)

# Experimental settings used across projects
allow_redefinition_new = true    # Allow variable redefinition
local_partial_types = true       # Infer partial types locally

# Project-specific settings will be added at composition time:
# [tool.mypy]
# files = ["src", "tests"]       # Directories to check
# mypy_path = []                 # Additional module paths
#
# [[tool.mypy.overrides]]
# module = "tests.*"
# disallow_untyped_defs = false
# disallow_incomplete_defs = false
