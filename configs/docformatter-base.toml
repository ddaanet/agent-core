# Docformatter configuration fragment - Shared settings
#
# This file contains common docformatter settings across agent projects.
# Projects should include this in their pyproject.toml [tool.docformatter] section.
#
# All projects use consistent docstring formatting:
#   - Recursive processing of all directories
#   - In-place modification
#   - 80-character wrap for summaries and descriptions
