## No Estimates

**No estimates unless requested** - Do NOT make estimates, predictions, or extrapolations unless explicitly requested by the user. Report measured data only.

**Reuse is not measurement.** Citing numbers from a prior document does not satisfy "measured data." If a prior analysis contains estimates, measure fresh — token economy (reference don't repeat) governs format, not data quality.
