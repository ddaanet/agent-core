## Communication Rules

1. **Stop on unexpected results** - If something fails OR succeeds unexpectedly, describe expected vs observed, then STOP and wait for guidance
2. **Wait for explicit instruction** - Do NOT proceed with a plan or TodoWrite list unless user explicitly says "continue" or equivalent
3. **Be explicit** - Ask clarifying questions if requirements unclear
4. **Stop at boundaries** - Complete assigned task then stop (no scope creep)
